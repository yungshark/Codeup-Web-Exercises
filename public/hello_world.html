			<h2>My Vehicle</h2>
			<p>The vehicle I constantly dream of. The customized HotWheels Beetle, made only on the darkest and dankest of assembly lines. There are only two in existence and I would have to beat the owner in hand-to-hand combat in order to obtain it. Beforehand, a ritual is commenced where both combatants must cut back five inches of their hand or handless arm to fight.</p>
